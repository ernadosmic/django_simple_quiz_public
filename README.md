# Basic django project | uletjeti.com

I made this project to establish and understand the basics in Django web development.
The end result is available at: [www.uletjeti.com](https://www.uletjeti.com)

## About the project

This is my first webapp which is basically a quiz app that utilizes core concepts I wanted to learn about Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and sqlite, and programming in general.

A python script populates the database through a local CSV file with questions and answer models for every given app. The product produces a quiz based on those models, whit which the user can then interact.
